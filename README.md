We present a high-quality dataset for multi-human interactive talking video generation, comprising over \$12\$ hours of high-resolution conversational clips with diverse interaction patterns and approximately \$200\$ distinct identities from two talk shows. These curated videos form the core of our dataset, selected for their natural, engaging interactions, clear speaker dynamics, and avoidance of common visual phenomena in real-world videos such as camera motion, occlusions, and editing artifactsâ€”ensuring clean yet diverse multi-speaker scenarios. This serves as an ideal starting resource for this challenging new task. Some samples are shown below:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
        <img src="assets/main_video/example_1.gif" width="250">
    </td>
    <td>
        <img src="assets/main_video/example_2.gif" width="250">
    </td>
    <td>
        <img src="assets/main_video/example_4.gif" width="250">
    </td>
     <td>
        <img src="assets/main_video/example_8.gif" width="250">
    </td>
    <td>
        <img src="assets/main_video/example_6.gif" width="250">

    <td>

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>


To showcase the potential of our data collection pipeline and further increase dataset diversity, we expand our dataset with an additional 3 hours of video from the YouTube short film channel Omeleto, which features rich, natural interactions and diverse character dynamics.
While these additional videos do not contain shot transitions, they may include camera motion, occlusions, and other real-world artifacts. We believe this subset serves as a challenging and complementary test set that augments the cleaner, studio-style data in the main dataset.
Representative samples are shown below:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
        <img src="assets/extended_video/vid_10_10.gif" width="250">
    </td>
    <td>
        <img src="assets/extended_video/vid_8_10.gif" width="250">
    </td>
    <td>
        <img src="assets/extended_video/vid_3_10.gif" width="250">
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
